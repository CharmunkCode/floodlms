    <h1>Some Stuff is happening</h1>
        <h2 >Hi Guys! Char here, I got a paragraph for you, but if you dont want to read it just click <a href="https://play.cheeseburgersmp.lol"> here</a> to play</h2>
        <span>So I have been getting word that the school is looking for me, as of my links. Well school, if you are reading this, I have some question for you.</span>
        <br>
        <span>First, I do not run my server at school or on school property, so I do not see how you possibly have any juristiction over it.</span>
        <span>Second, Instead of punishing someone who created something to have fun with friends in there free time, maybe punish the kids who abuse it during class? Lastly, This one is more of a statement. The CIPA was created to protect kids from dangerous material online. It was not created for you guys to block any site that midly annoys you</span>
        <br>
        <h4>I doubt anyone at the school will read this, but if you our reading it, thanks for taking time to listen to what I have to say.</h4>
        <h3>Now on the bright side, heres some server news!</h3>
        <span>All of the recent crashes should now be fixed everyone!</span>
        <h2>That's all! Thanks for reading everyone!</h2>
